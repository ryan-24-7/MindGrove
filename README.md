What We Built:

· MindGrove is an AI-powered journaling tool that utilizes CNNs to enhance user growth and provide real-time feedback on human emotion. 
· Users can enter any audio or text file and receive instant analysis on their emotions. 
· Furthermore, it also displays comprehensive graphs and visualizations to chart emotions over any time frame.

Why We Built:

· We were obsessed with using growth as a metric and enhance productivity and wellness.
· People develop all sorts of metrics and KPIs to track startup or product growth, however there are few tools out there that track human growth.
· We went ahead and chose "emotion" as a variable to track over time, as we thought it might give a decent amount of insights to users about themselves.
· "Users should get the opportunity to iteratively observe and develop themselves akin to agile development cycles"
